# 🐾 PetPals - Pet Boarding & Short-Term Experience Platform

## 🌟 Project Overview

PetPals is an innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) platform designed to connect 
pet owners needing short-term boarding (1-8 weeks) with families who can offer loving care for that duration.

### Core Value Proposition

* **For Pet Owners :** Helps pet owners find families who can care for their pets for a short period
                    when they are unable to do so due to short-term business trips or travel.
                    The safety and comfort of their pets are of paramount importance.
* **For Caregivers :** Allows animal lovers (those who cannot keep pets long-term or want to care for more animals)
                    to experience the joy of caring for and interacting with animals.

## ✨ Key Features

* **User Registration/Login:** Supports Google or Email sign-up and login.
* **Find Pets:** Enables quick filtering by **type**, **fosterStartDate**, **fosterDuration**, and **location**.
* **My Pets:** See all the pets user have uploaded. Change and edit the matching state of user's pet.
* **Post A NEW Pet:** Allows pet owners to post pet profiles complete with pictures and detailed information.
